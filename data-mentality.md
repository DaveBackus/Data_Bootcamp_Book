# The data mentality


---
**Overview.** Thinking about data, project ideas.  

---


Data analysis starts with a question.  Generally, we want to learn something.  In our world, we might ask

* What emerging market countries offer the best business environments?
* How is the US economy doing right now?  
* How do returns on US and European stocks compare?    
* How does average income vary across countries?  Across states?  Across zip codes?  
* Where are our best customers?  

You get the idea.  The starting point is a question, something you'd like to know, not the data itself.  

Once we have a question, we can start looking for data that might help us come up with an answer. We might ask ourselves:  What data would be helpful in answering our question?  Where can we find it?  What should we do with it once we have it?  

The question comes from you.  What we provide is a mentality for thinking about data and a toolset to work with it effectively.  


## Develop a data mentality 

It's not that we have no lives or anything, but we think about data all the time.  If we see an interesting graphic in *The Economist* -- or the *Wall Street Journal*, or the *New York Times*, or a blog post -- we look immediately for the source.  Is it one we know?  Can we get it ourselves?  If we have the data, do we have the tools to reproduce the graphic?  

You can ask the same questions yourself.  Here are some examples to practice on:  

* [FRED](https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/GDP).  Our go-to source for macroeconomic data.  The "Notes" tab gives us the original source if we want to dig deeper.  
* [Gapminder world](http://www.gapminder.org/world/).  Great interactive graphic.  The [data page](http://www.gapminder.org/data/) gives sources.  
* [Market caps of tech firms](http://www.economist.com/techfirms).  Interesting to see how quickly tech firms come and go.  Is that true of other industries? 
* [Economic mobility by region](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/22/business/in-climbing-income-ladder-location-matters.html).  We love maps.  This one shows that kids do better (relative to their parents) in some places than others.  Why is that?  What's wrong with the South?  
* [Vaccination heatmaps](http://graphics.wsj.com/infectious-diseases-and-vaccines/).  A striking representation of diseases over time, probably motivated by the decisions of some [rich people in California](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/02/06/us/california-measles-vaccines-map.html) [not to vaccinate](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/01/27/californias-epidemic-of-vaccine-denial-mapped/) their children.  Here's a related [blog post](https://benjaminlmoore.wordpress.com/2015/04/09/recreating-the-vaccination-heatmaps-in-r/) with R code.  (Which reminds us:  If you see R code, you should think, great, we can convert this to Python.)
* [Bloomberg on mortality](http://www.bloomberg.com/dataview/2014-04-17/how-americans-die.html).  This is really cool.  It's beyond us technically, at least for the moment, but the ingredients are all things we can access.  And between us friends, the decline in mortality (people are living longer) is one of the most interesting things about the modern world.  Check Gapminder on life expectancy if that doesn't strike you.  

Which ones do you like?  What did you like about them?  What would it take for you to reproduce them?  Do they suggest followup questions?  

This isn't something you need to do on your own --  it's way more fun to talk to others, especially if you can get free work out of them.  Ask your friends what they think.  Post a question or comment on our Google Group.  Google the topic and see what else pops up.    


**Exercise.** What kinds of things would you like to know more about?  Think of this as improv, there are no bad answers. 


## Projects 

One of our goals is for you to have a piece of work -- data and graphics -- that you can show potential employers.  There's nothing like an example to show off your skill set.  Don't worry about the topic, it's the skill set you're showing off.  We're getting a little ahead of ourselves, but we thought it would be useful to talk about this now so we know where we're headed.  

**Sample projects.** A typical project might be an IPython notebook that uses data to make a point. Here are some examples, but feel free to suggest your own:  

* [NBA shot charts](http://savvastjortjoglou.com/nba-shot-sharts.html).  If you're into that kind of thing.  Honestly, this is a terrific project that produces some great pictures and shows you how along the way.  Here's the [IPython notebook](https://github.com/savvastj/blog/blob/master/content/NBA_shot_charts.ipynb).   
* [US employment](https://github.com/DaveBackus/Data_Bootcamp/blob/master/Code/Projects/Employment-Population-Ratio_DavidCai_Jul_15.ipynb).  David Cai documents the recent decline in the fraction of adults working.  The question is why. Are we getting lazier?  Or something else?  
* More ...

We've put together a list [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hsuYz2IMoPPwba66BlyMW0tnMxuZPyH4F3ybc13Zsfk/edit?usp=sharing) of other ideas.  You might give them a skim, see if anything appeals to you.  


**Paths to project ideas.**  If you're looking for ideas, there are a number of places you could start:  

* Start with what interests you:  economics, finance, marketing, emerging markets, movies, sports 
* Start with output:  find an analyst report, blog post, or graphic you like, ask where the data comes from, whether you can replicate/extend 
* Start with input:  Economics and finance data:  huge universe of stuff, what can you do with it? 
Develop what you have:  all starting points lead to others, bounce around ideas over coffee with friends, take a long walk 

Project alternatives 

* Implement a new tool and write a guide for other students (plot.ly, Google Viz, ...) 
* Learn how to use a new dataset and write a guide for other students (ACS, ATUS, PSID, IMDb,...)  

Common mistakes -- and solutions to them  

* Mistake:  Reject an idea before you’ve given it enough thought.  Solution:  Collect ideas first, whittle them down later.  

* Mistake:  Choose a project that’s too large.  Solution:  Think it over for a while, choose a small part.  (You can always do more later.) 

* Mistake:  Pick a dataset that’s not available or doesn’t have what you need.  Solution:  Start with what you have, ask what you can do with it.

## Idea machines 

Ideas are promiscuous:  one idea often generates several others.  So a good starting point is a collection of examples.  Find some you like and see where they lead.
