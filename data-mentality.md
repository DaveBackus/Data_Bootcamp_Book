***************************


The data mentality:  when you see a graph, table, etc that you like, ask questions:  
Where did the data came from?
Can you replicate it?
What follow-up questions cross your mind?   

Examples (too many, do a subset) 
Emerging market indicators:  indicators of business conditions by country from the World Bank 
Business cycle indicators:  indicators of US economic growth 
Demographics:   current and projected age distribution of populations by country 
Equity returns:  distributions of returns on Fama-French equity portfolios, what would $1000 in 1950 be worth now?  
Term structure of interest rates:  dynamics of the term structure if interest rates 
Options:  prices of puts and calls by strike, implied volatility smiles

Project output
A short report or IPython notebook that uses data to make a point 
Something you can show employers to illustrate your skill set 

Project ideas and how to get them 
Start with what interests you:  economics, finance, marketing, emerging markets, movies, sports 
Start with output:  find an analyst report, blog post, or graphic you like, ask where the data comes from, whether you can replicate/extend 
Start with input:  Economics and finance data:  huge universe of stuff, what can you do with it? 
Develop what you have:  all starting points lead to others, bounce around ideas over coffee with friends, take a long walk 

Process
Remember:  “ideas have friends”  

Common mistakes -- and solutions to them  
Mistake:  Reject an idea before you’ve given it enough thought.  Solution:  Collect ideas first, whittle them down later.  
Mistake:  Choose a project that’s too large.  Solution:  Think it over for a while, choose a small part.  (You can always do more later.) 
Mistake:  Pick a dataset that’s not available or doesn’t have what you need.  Solution:  Start with what you have, ask what you can do with it.    

Project alternatives 
Implement a new tool and write a guide for other students (plot.ly, Google Viz, ...) 
Learn how to use a new dataset and write a guide for other students (ACS, ATUS, PSID, IMDb,...)
