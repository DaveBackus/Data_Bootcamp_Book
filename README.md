## Preface

This [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/book/davebackus/test/details) was written by Dave Backus, Chase Coleman, and Spencer Lyon for a [course](https://github.com/DaveBackus/Data_Bootcamp#data-bootcamp) at [NYU](http://www.nyu.edu/)'s [Stern School of Business](http://www.stern.nyu.edu/).  Our goals are to give students experience with economic and financial data and to introduce programming newbies to the benefits of moving beyond Excel.  It's based on the Python programming language, which we think is the tool of choice for modern data analysis.  We use Python's data management (pandas) and graphics (matplotlib) packages extensively.  

The book comes in multiple formats.  You can access it on the internet.  Or you can download (and print) a pdf file.  The former comes with links, which we think is a huge advantage, and can be updated quickly, but if you like paper by all means try the pdf.  All of them are available at

## Warning

This is **work in progress**, target date January 2016.  We've written 5 chapters so far, the rest are rough notes or less.  

## Acknowledgements 

This project was Glenn Okun's idea.  We should probably thank him, but he really should have done it himself. We do appreciate his support. Paul Backus, Sarah Beckett-Hile (MBA16), and Hersh Iyer (MBA17) contributed technical support and applications.  Sarah is proof that English majors can code as well as anyone. You may also notice a resemblance to Tom Sargent and John Stachurski's [Quantitative Economics](http://quant-econ.net/), a wonderful Python-based course in dynamic macroeconomic theory.  We thank them for their advice and encouragement.
