Preface
=======

This book was developed for a [course](https://github.com/DaveBackus/Data_Bootcamp#data-bootcamp) at NYU's Stern School of Business.  The intent is to give students experience with economic and financial data and to introduce programming novices to the benefits of moving beyond Excel.  It's based on the Python programming language -- in our view, the tool of choice for modern data analysis.  We use Python's data (pandas) and graphics (matplotlib) packages extensively.
