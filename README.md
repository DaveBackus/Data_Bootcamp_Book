Preface
=======

This [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/book/davebackus/test/details) was written by Dave Backus, Chase Coleman, and Spencer Lyon for a [course](https://github.com/DaveBackus/Data_Bootcamp#data-bootcamp) at NYU's Stern School of Business.  The intent is to give students experience with economic and financial data and to introduce programming novices to the benefits of moving beyond Excel.  It's based on the Python programming language, which we think is the tool of choice for modern data analysis.  We use Python's data management (pandas) and graphics (matplotlib) packages extensively.  


**Acknowledgements.** This project was Glenn Okun's idea.  We should probably thank him, but he really should have done this himself. We do appreciate his support. Paul Backus is our technical consultant. Sarah Beckett-Hile (MBA16) is rapidly adding to our collection of applications and is proof that English majors can code as well as anyone. You may also notice a resemblance to Tom Sargent and John Stachurski's [Quantitative Economics](http://quant-econ.net/), a wonderful Python-based course in dynamic macroeconomic theory. We thank them for their advice and encouragement.
