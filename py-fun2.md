## Conditionals

## Functions 


```
def greet(name):
    print 'Hello', name
greet('Jack')
greet('Jill')
greet('Bob')
```

```
friends = ['john', 'pat', 'gary', 'michael']
for i, name in enumerate(friends):
    print "iteration {iteration} is {name}".format(iteration=i, name=name)
```


##  Other data structures

This whole section is mtyn:  we recommend you skim it, but don't worry about the details, you can come back to them if needed.  

The term **data structure** refers to the organization of a collection of data.  A list is a data structure.  ...  

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure

Examples: tuples, dictionaries, and sets.  We'll cover them later as needed.
If you run across one of these terms, keep in mind it's just a different form
of organization, we can look up its properties when we need to.


## Programming style

Yes, style counts.  

PEP8 etc \\

\item Assignment idea:  convert list of strings to list with number of letters in each.  \\
Do in class?  \\
