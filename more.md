## Fuzzy wuzzy 


## Large datasets

From Itamar:  I tried playing around with some of the examples below and others I found.
My key insight is that the data sets are extremely large (at least few GB each), and therefore the way to access the data is by running SQL-lite queries as part of the API request and load to memory only aggregated data. 
As far as I remember we said SQL is not a focus of this course. For that reason I don't think this data set can be handy for us. 
Let me know if you guys think otherwise.

## Other coding enviroments 

There are lots of coding environments out there.  Spyder is the easiest, in our view, but there are lots of choices.  

* Dave uses **Spyder** because he likes its old school Matlab look and feel.  
* Chase and Spencer use **[Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/)**, an editor that can be customized to do almost anything.  Paul does the same with **[Vim](http://www.vim.org/)**.  Both are text editors only.  You run Python from the command line, which is even more old school.    
* Lots of people recommend **[Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/)**.  Dave thinks this is the tool of choice for someone who wants to go to the next level:  slightly harder than Spyder to get going, but way more powerful once you do.  Among other things, it looks really cool. 

Here are [two](https://wiki.python.org/moin/IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironments) [lists](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1keync/best_free_python_ide/) if you'd like to get a sense of what's out there and what others think about it. 

## R

**Install R.** If you decide you'd like to try R some time, [choose a "mirror"](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html) and download the appropriate version.  We recommend you run it in [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/), a popular coding environment. Both are free.  Once you've installed them, start up RStudio and it will access R as needed. 

Things to check out

1. Conda.  This could have promise:  Continuum support of R.  Two things:

* You can install from conda, which you have if you installed Anaconda.  

* You can run in a Jupyter notebook, as Brian mentioned.   

The bad news is that it doesn't seem to have RStudio, which I like.

3. Princeton's intro.

**Learn R.** If you want to learn how to program in R, there's lots of good stuff online -- too much, really.  We like these: 

* [Try R](http://tryr.codeschool.com/) is like Codecademy, you run code online.  
* Princeton:  http://data.princeton.edu/R/ 
* List http://www.r-bloggers.com/learning-r-index-of-online-r-courses-october-2015/
* Kelly Black has a [tutorial](http://www.cyclismo.org/tutorial/R/) that covers more advanced topics, including introductory statistics.  
* [Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) combines R programming with an introduction to modern statistics and machine learning.  
* NYU https://github.com/pablobarbera/data-science-workshop

We also like the blog aggregator **[R-bloggers](http://www.r-bloggers.com/)**, which is filled with applications, including code.
