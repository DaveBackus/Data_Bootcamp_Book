## R

If you decide you'd like to try R some time, [choose a "mirror"](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html) and download the appropriate version.  We recommend you run it in [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/), a popular coding environment. Both are free.  Once you've installed them, start up RStudio and it will access R as needed.    

There's lots of good stuff online -- too much, really -- but we like these two in particular: 

* [Try R](http://tryr.codeschool.com/) is like Codecademy, you run code online.  
* Kelly Black has a [tutorial](http://www.cyclismo.org/tutorial/R/) that covers more advanced topics, including introductory statistics.  
* [Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) combines R programming with an introduction to modern statistics and machine learning.
